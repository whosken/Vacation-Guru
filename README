search process

1 (per request) searcher checks if place_store already has query place via HEAD request
2 (per new entry) adds query to scrape list
3 (per new entry) requestor scrapes data source for place description
4 (per new entry) encoder transforms description into tf-idf scores
5 (per new entry) cluster places via ??? to identify cluster averages
6 (per request) filter compares query with group averages via cos-sim for best matched k clusters
7 (per request) filter ranks members of best match clusters via cos-sim

typical search:
if existing entry: 1 -> 6 -> 7
else: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 6 -> 7

typical cron:
2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
